# AutoMapBlur

**Original Idea:**  
This project was conceptualized by [@WhyTrashEarth](https://x.com/WhyTrashEarth) to enhance the streaming experience by automatically applying a blur effect when the in-game map is opened, preventing stream sniping in games like **Fortnite, PUBG, Apex Legends**, and others. This was heavily inspired by streamer Tacts, I became so tired of many pros and casual players like him being cheated or harassed online. I have submitted other ideas to Epic, but they will not respond... So it is time to for the users to take matters into their own hands.

## Purpose  
AutoMapBlur is designed to help streamers protect sensitive in-game information from being exposed during live streams. By blurring the map when the designated key is pressed, this tool aims to reduce the risk of stream sniping and improve fairness in competitive gaming.

## Features
- **Default Map Key:** The default key to trigger the blur is "M," a common map key in many games.
- **Custom Keybinding:** Streamers can easily change the keybinding to match their preferred in-game setup.
- **Adjustable Blur Intensity:** The blur effect can be customized to match user preferences.

## Installation Instructions
**To install AutoMapBlur:**
1. Select your platform from the list (OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, etc.) in the repository.
2. Follow the specific README file within the respective folder for detailed instructions on how to set up the tool for your platform.
    - **OBS Studio Users:** Navigate to `/OBS Studio/README_OBS.md`
    - **Streamlabs OBS Users:** Navigate to `/Streamlabs OBS/README_Streamlabs.md`
    - **XSplit Users:** Navigate to `/XSplit/README_XSplit.md`

## Usage
- **Automatic Blur:** AutoMapBlur blurs the game capture whenever the map key (default "M") is pressed. When the key is pressed again, the blur is removed.
- **Customization:** Adjust both the keybinding and blur intensity via the settings within your streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs, or XSplit).
