# AutoMapBlur for OBS Studio

AutoMapBlur allows you to automatically blur your game capture whenever the in-game map is opened, protecting sensitive information and preventing stream sniping.

## Features
- **Toggle Blur:** Press the map key (default: "M") to toggle the blur on/off for your game capture in OBS.
- **Customizable Keybinding:** You can customize the key used to trigger the blur.
- **Adjustable Blur Intensity:** Modify the blur intensity to suit your preference, from 1 (light blur) to 20 (heavy blur).

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the `AutoMapBlur_OBS.py` script.
2. In OBS Studio, go to **Tools > Scripts**.
3. Click the **+** button and browse to select `AutoMapBlur_OBS.py` from your downloads.
4. After adding, the script will appear in the Scripts window.
